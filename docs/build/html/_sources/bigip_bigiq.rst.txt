BIG-IP API vs BIG-IQ API
========================

| Majority of the F5 iControl REST API functionalities are the same for both BIG-IP and BIG-IQ.
| However, some major differences exist, so BIGREST treats BIG-IP and BIG-IQ devices different.
| For BIG-IP use the class BIGIP, for BIG-IQ use the class BIGIQ.

BIG-IP
------

**TOC**

When using BIGREST for a BIG-IP device, the simplest way to find out the HTTP path you need is to use the TOC.

To access TOC:

.. code-block::

   https://<hostname or IP>/mgmt/toc

**API**

| BIG-IP API use is simpler than BIG-IQ API.
| Majority of the HTTP paths starts with **/mgmt/tm/**.

| There are also some HTTP paths that I guess were create to be used by BIG-IQ when managing a BIG-IP device.
| Those HTTP paths start with **/mgmt/cm/**.

| The API is similar to tmsh commands.
| If you want to list all virtual servers using tmsh you do:

.. code-block::

   tmsh list ltm virtual

If you want list all virtual servers using the API, you do:

.. code-block::

   GET https://<hostname or IP>/mgmt/tm/ltm/virtual

If you want to list a single virtual server using tmsh you do:

.. code-block::

   tmsh list ltm virtual <virtual server name>

If you want to list a single virtual server using the API you do:

.. code-block::

   GET https://<hostname or IP>/mgmt/tm/ltm/virtual/<virtual server name>

**Documentation**

| iControl REST User Guide provides a good explanation about the API:

| At the time I am writing this documentation, 14.1.0 is the lastest version for this guide, but 15.1.0 is the latest BIG-IP version.
